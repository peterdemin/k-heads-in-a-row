k-heads-in-a-row
================

Python module to investigate problem of getting k equal results in row in coin toss trial

Module output is
For random.randint(0, 1):
Sequence length - Probability
 1              - 1/3
 2              - 1/8
 3              - 1/15
 4              - 1/32
 5              - 1/64
 6              - 1/128
 7              - 1/255

16              - 1/142857
17              - 1/250000

I really tossed coin some times, and have got following
results:
Sequence length - Probability
 1              - 1/5.428
 2              - 1/7.600
 3              - 1/11.69
 4              - 1/38.00
 5              - 1/76.00
 6              - 1/76.00
 7              - 1/152.0

Which at most looks like the first one.
